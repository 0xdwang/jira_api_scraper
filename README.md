# jira_api_scraper
Jupyter notebook for scraping the JIRA API to track agile development progress during sprints. Data was then piped into Tableau and used to make these visualizations: https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.wang8663#!/

These dashboards were made and shipped during my summer internship at Hulu as a Technical Program Management Intern. I owned all ends of the development cycle from user research to dashboard design/prototyping, data engineering, and data visualization.
